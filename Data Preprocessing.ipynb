      "“This account of battle on the plains brings the period to life.”—Publishers Weekly Spring, 1876. The war cry has sounded. The Sioux and the Cheyenne are massing along the northern frontier. And even while his wife awaits the birth of their child, army scount Seamus Donegan knows he must head north to Fort Fetterman. Brigadier General George C. Crook is preparing to meet the fierce challenge laid down by the bold and brutal chief Crazy Horse, and the future hope of the nation rests in the strong hands and courageous hearts of men like Seamus Donegan. He yearns for a reunion with his wife, but the trail of that fateful campaign leads Donegan ever farther from home—toward the land of the Rosebud and a hard rain of blood and tears.\n",
